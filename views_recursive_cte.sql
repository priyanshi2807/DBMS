--  Experiment 5 : SQL Views, View Updatability and Recursive CTEs (MySQL 8.0+)
--  Uses the Employee-Department-Project schema from Experiment 3.
--
--  Run (Experiment 3 first, it creates and fills company_db):
--     mysql -u root -p -t < ../Experiment-3/company_queries.sql
--     mysql -u root -p -t --force < views_recursive_cte.sql
--  (--force keeps running after the intentional errors in Part C)
--  All data changes are undone in Part F, so company_db is left unchanged.
